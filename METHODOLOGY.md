# SAPITS Methodology

## ðŸ”’ Values and Principles

### 1. Security
Your data security is the MOST important aspect of SAPITS, and we want to explain how we achieve it.

- **Encrypted Hard Drives**: We use LUKS1/LUKS2 for full disk encryption, ensuring that even if someone gains physical access to the drives, they cannot access the data stored on computers dedicated exclusively to SAPITS.

- **Secure Operating System**: Secureblue is our default operating system, offering an optimal balance between usability for our technicians and maximum possible security for your data.

- **Password Model**: [Not Implemented] We are developing a decentralized system for managing hard drive and login passwords, preventing access centralization and reducing risks of corruption or security threats.

### 2. Anonymity

#### 2.1 Philosophical Foundations
Anonymity in SAPITS is not just a technical feature but a fundamental philosophical principle. We recognize that in an increasingly surveilled world, the right to privacy has become a basic necessity.

#### 2.2 Freedom of Expression and Identity Protection

##### Core Principles
- **Absence of Direct Human Interaction**:
  - The SAPITS model eliminates the possibility of interpersonal discrimination by removing human-to-human contact at all service points.
  - Automated systems are designed to be completely neutral, without the capacity to judge or discriminate based on personal characteristics.

- **Right to Anonymity**:
  - Users have the absolute right to protect their identity through any means of their choice.
  - Clothing, including items that cover the face or body, cannot be grounds for service denial.

##### Surveillance Considerations

1. **Use of Cameras**:
   - **Legal Compliance**: In jurisdictions where surveillance cameras are mandatory:
     - Only the minimum necessary cameras will be installed.
     - Their presence will be clearly indicated.
     - Recordings will be handled with the highest privacy standards.
   
   - **Data Protection**:
     - Recordings will be stored encrypted.
     - Access restricted to authorized personnel only.
     - Minimum retention period required by law.

2. **User Rights**:
   - **In the presence of cameras**:
     - Users retain their right to cover their face and body.
     - Service cannot be denied for exercising this right.
     - Recordings cannot be used to identify users without a court order.

   - **In the absence of cameras**:
     - The same privacy and anonymity rights are maintained.
     - Clothing cannot be grounds for suspicion or denial of service.

3. **Non-Discrimination**:
   - **Express prohibition** of service denial based on:
     - Choice of clothing or face coverings.
     - Physical appearance.
     - Any perceived personal characteristic.

   - **Protection against profiling**:
     - SAPITS systems do not create appearance-based profiles.
     - No facial recognition or biometric systems are used.
     - No personally identifiable data is stored.

#### 2.3 Anonymous Identification System [In Development]

##### Design Considerations
- **Implementation dilemmas**:
  - Balance between utility and privacy.
  - User experience vs. Security.
  - Censorship resistance.

##### Technical Proposal
1. **Identifier Generation**:
   - Cryptographically secure algorithms.
   - Minimum 256 bits of entropy.
   - Base58 encoding for easier manual transcription.

2. **Communication Channels**:
   - SimpleX as communication base.
   - No persistent user addresses.
   - End-to-end encryption by default.

#### 2.4 Future Roadmap

##### Next Steps
1. **Research phase**
2. **Prototype development**
3. **Bug bounty program**

##### Call to Community
We invite security experts, cryptographers, and privacy enthusiasts to contribute their knowledge and experience.
